# Attendance Table Formatter (one click two events)

Welcome to the Attendance Table Formatter repository! This project showcases an interactive HTML table designed to display an attendance sheet for a month. The JavaScript code included in the HTML file enhances the visualization of attendance data by applying distinct formatting to the table cells based on the attendance status of each student.

## Features

- The HTML table displays student IDs, names, and daily attendance records with 'P' (Present), 'A' (Absent), and 'L' (Late) indicators.
- Click the "Apply Formatting" button to highlight 'A' and 'L' records in red and orange, respectively.
- Click the "Clear Formatting" button to reset the formatting to the default state.
- 

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. The attendance records will be displayed, with 'P' for Present, 'A' for Absent, and 'L' for Late.
3. Click the "Apply Formatting" button to highlight 'A' and 'L' records.
4. Click the "Clear Formatting" button to reset the formatting.
